          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About LCM & GCD Calculator</h2>
          <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700 space-y-4">
            <p>Our LCM & GCD Calculator is a powerful, free online tool that instantly calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD, also known as HCF - Highest Common Factor) of two or more numbers. Whether you're a student learning number theory, a teacher creating worksheets, or someone solving real-world mathematical problems, this calculator provides accurate results with detailed step-by-step explanations.</p>

            <p>Understanding LCM and GCD is fundamental to mathematics, particularly in arithmetic, algebra, and number theory. These concepts appear in countless applications from simplifying fractions to scheduling problems, making this calculator an essential tool for students, educators, mathematicians, and professionals working with numbers.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">What is LCM (Least Common Multiple)?</h3>
            <p>The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the numbers. In simpler terms, it's the smallest number that all your input numbers can divide into evenly without leaving a remainder.</p>

            <p>For example, consider the numbers 4 and 6. The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24... The multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30... The common multiples are 12, 24, 36, and so on. The smallest of these common multiples is 12, so LCM(4, 6) = 12.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">What is GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)?</h3>
            <p>The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), also called the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) or Highest Common Factor (HCF), is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder. It's the biggest number that is a factor of all your input numbers.</p>

            <p>For example, with numbers 12 and 18: The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The factors of 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. The common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest of these is 6, so GCD(12, 18) = 6.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">How to Use This Calculator</h3>
            <p>Using our LCM & GCD calculator is incredibly simple:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Enter two or more whole numbers in the input field</li>
              <li>Separate numbers with commas, spaces, or both</li>
              <li>Click "Calculate LCM & GCD" to get instant results</li>
              <li>View both the LCM and GCD simultaneously</li>
              <li>Read the step-by-step calculation process to understand how the results were obtained</li>
              <li>Try the quick examples for common number combinations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Calculation Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Finding GCD - The Euclidean Algorithm:</strong> Our calculator uses the efficient Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. This ancient algorithm (dating back to around 300 BC) repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller and takes the remainder, replacing the larger with the smaller and the smaller with the remainder, until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.</p>

            <p><strong>Finding LCM:</strong> Once we have the GCD, we can calculate LCM using the mathematical relationship: LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b). For more than two numbers, we apply this formula successively, finding the LCM of the first two numbers, then the LCM of that result with the third number, and so on.</p>

            <p><strong>LCM Applications:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Fraction Operations:</strong> Finding common denominators when adding or subtracting fractions requires finding the LCM of the denominators</li>
              <li><strong>Scheduling Problems:</strong> If two events occur every X and Y days, the LCM tells you when they'll occur together</li>
              <li><strong>Gear Ratios:</strong> In mechanical engineering, LCM helps calculate when gears with different teeth counts will return to their starting position</li>
              <li><strong>Music Theory:</strong> Finding when different rhythm patterns align</li>
              <li><strong>Tile Layouts:</strong> Determining the smallest square that can be perfectly tiled with rectangular tiles</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>GCD Applications:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Simplifying Fractions:</strong> The GCD of numerator and denominator is used to reduce fractions to lowest terms</li>
              <li><strong>Distribution Problems:</strong> Finding the largest group size when dividing items equally</li>
              <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Many encryption algorithms rely on GCD calculations, particularly in RSA encryption</li>

              <li><strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> Simplifying aspect ratios and scaling calculations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Understanding the Relationship</h3>
            <p>LCM and GCD are mathematically related through an elegant formula: For any two positive integers a and b, LCM(a, b) × GCD(a, b) = a × b. This relationship allows efficient calculation of one when you know the other.</p>

            <p>Another important property: If two numbers are coprime (their GCD is 1), their LCM is simply their product. For example, GCD(7, 11) = 1 (they're coprime), so LCM(7, 11) = 7 × 11 = 77.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Tips for Students</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

                <p>LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest positive number that is divisible by all given numbers - it's the smallest number that contains all your numbers as factors. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor), also known as HCF, is the largest positive number that divides all given numbers without remainder - it's the biggest number that is a factor of all your numbers. For example, for 12 and 18: LCM is 36 (smallest number both divide into evenly) and GCD is 6 (largest number that divides both evenly). They're opposite concepts: LCM is about multiples, GCD is about divisors.</p>

                <p>To calculate LCM of multiple numbers, you can use two main methods: 1) <strong>Prime Factorization Method:</strong> Find prime factorization of each number, then for each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in any factorization, and multiply these together. 2) <strong>Successive Method:</strong> Find LCM of the first two numbers using the formula LCM(a,b) = (a × b) / GCD(a,b), then find LCM of that result with the third number, continue until all numbers are processed. Our calculator uses the efficient successive method with the Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method to find GCD that dates back to ancient Greece (around 300 BC). Here's how it works: Given two numbers a and b (where a ≥ b), divide a by b and find the remainder r. Then replace a with b and b with r, and repeat the process. Continue until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD. Example for GCD(48, 18): 48 = 18×2 + 12, then 18 = 12×1 + 6, then 12 = 6×2 + 0. The last non-zero remainder is 6, so GCD(48, 18) = 6. This method is much faster than listing all factors, especially for large numbers.</p>

                <span>Can LCM and GCD be calculated for more than two numbers?</span>
                <span class="faq-icon text-xl">+</span>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes, absolutely! Both LCM and GCD can be calculated for any quantity of numbers. For GCD, the property is associative: GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(GCD(a, b), c). You find GCD of the first two numbers, then find GCD of that result with the third number, and continue. The same principle applies to LCM: LCM(a, b, c) = LCM(LCM(a, b), c). Our calculator handles this automatically for any quantity of numbers you enter. For example, for numbers 12, 18, and 24: GCD(12,18) = 6, then GCD(6,24) = 6, so the overall GCD is 6. LCM(12,18) = 36, then LCM(36,24) = 72, so the overall LCM is 72.</p>

                <span>What are practical applications of LCM and GCD?</span>
                <span class="faq-icon text-xl">+</span>
              </div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>LCM and GCD have numerous real-world applications: <strong>LCM</strong> is essential for adding/subtracting fractions (finding common denominators), scheduling recurring events (finding when multiple cycles align), solving gear ratio problems in engineering, music theory (rhythm alignment), and tile layout planning. <strong>GCD</strong> is used for simplifying fractions to lowest terms, dividing items into equal groups without remainder, finding optimal tile sizes for floors, cryptography (especially RSA encryption), reducing ratios, and computer graphics calculations. In computer science, both are used in algorithm optimization, digital signal processing, and memory management. These concepts are fundamental in mathematics education and appear in everything from elementary arithmetic to advanced number theory and cryptography.</p>
